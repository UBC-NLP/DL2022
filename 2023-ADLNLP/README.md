# NLP702 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

* Instructor: Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Mageed

## 1. Course Rationale & Goal
* Catalog Description: This course provides a methodological and an in-depth background on key core Natural Language Processing areas based on deep learning. It builds upon fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing and assumes familiarization with mathematical and machine learning concepts and programming. 
* Goal: This graduate-level course aims to instill a deeper and thorough understanding of advanced Natural Language Processing methods based on deep learning, to equip students with capabilities of researching, developing, and implementing these methods.
* The course covers the following key core areas: (I) Foundation Models, (II) Representation Learning for NLP, (III) Machine Translation (IV) Multilinguality and Low-Resource NLP, (V) Speech-Language Interface, and (VI) Vision-Language Interface
